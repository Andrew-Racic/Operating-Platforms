# Operating-Platforms

1.  Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client was The Gaming Room, and they were wanting CTS to expand their already well established gaming platform "Draw it or Lose It", so that it could be played by users on multiple platforms.  
The software they wanted us to design was to take their current game "Draw It or Lose It" and make it available on multiple platforms streamlining their development.  They specifically wanted for each game and team to be unique, and for the game to only be allowed one instance to exist in the memory at a time.  Each team will be able to have more than one player and the game has to allow for multiple or single teams playing per game.  

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

Designing this document I fell that I did my research to find all options and outcomes available particularly well.  As well as articulating my thoughts and findings into understandable and acceptable communicative terms.  

4. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working throught the design document while developing the code helped me to recognize certain mistakes before I made them and gave me somewhat of a roadmap for writing my code making it more efficient and less time debugging.

   5.  If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
   
If I had to choose one part of this document to revise I would pick the table.  I would improve it by adding more information into it instead of just the things I thought were most important because what I think might be most important may not seem as important to the client.  So I would add more information to the table which would help to provide a bigger and clearer picture of all options.

   6.  How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting the user's needs for a program like "Draw It or Lose It" involves understanding the unique requirements of a gaming environment.  So by considering factors like the games pace, the user intuitiveness, and the overall user expirience directly impacts the success of the software, if you create a game that aligns with the user's expecatations the that will lead to higher satisfaction, increased engagement, and better retention rates.  In the world of gaming meeting the users needs can mean the difference between a game that is an instant hit and a game that is quickly forgotten.  I did this by following what the client said they wanted and by thinking about the end user and putting myself in their shoes what would I want the game to do, what would I want them game not to do?

7.  How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

Research and comparison is my first to approach to almost everything, researching different strategies, reading about specific topics that can give me insight into ideas or tricks that I had not known or thought about.  I also like using Agile Methodologies when getting ready to start a project.  It helps to take things a piece at a time, debug often, and the end result comes out great.
